This is assignment for Programming for Networks subject at University.

The basic idea: The Tutoring System would register tutors interested in helping students, the subjects for 
which the tutors are qualified to assist in, and the number of hours each tutor would be available to tutor. 
When students register with the Tutoring System, they supply their name, contact details and the subjects 
that they are enrolled in.  The student can ask the Tutoring System to supply a listing of tutors who are 
available to tutor in a particular subject for which that student is enrolled in.  The listing includes the 
contact details of suitable tutors and the amount of hours they are available to tutor. 
 
In this assignment you will design and create the Tutoring System software in three different versions. 
Your software system will be implemented firstly as an application on a local machine. 
Next you will create a GUI version, and finally a version to run on a server, so that student clients 
can run the client program to send requests to the server hosting the Tutoring System.
